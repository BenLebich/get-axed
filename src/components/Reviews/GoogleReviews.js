My advice throw it like a baseball. Loved that they had seltzers..not a big beer fan. They had everyone spread out...since it wasn't to busy. Went on a Saturday, mid day.

They have a large beer selection, and several different games you can play while hatchet throwing. We had a great time, the other couples we spoke with all where friendly and seemed to enjoy themselves as well. If your a local looking for something different, or from out of town, looking for an out of the box adventure for a get together with friends, family, or date night, give Get Axed a try, and enjoy yourselves.",
